I discussed my solution with: Anna Zhang, Peter Yu

Discussion (major conceptual and coding difficulties):

The major conceptual difficulty was to understand Docker and Kubernetes, especially
their key concepts. The notion of Docker container was relative straightforward (also
because I have experience with Docker), but Kubernetes concepts, such as Service and
Deployment, were a lot harder to conceptualize. It was also a bit confusing when I
was going through the Kubernetes setup. It took a while to understand what the YAML
files were doing, and how the objects interacted. However, after playing around with
the lab for a bit, I think I have a better understanding of them now.

Another difficulty was to connect Docker containers to the Docker host, i.e. connecting
the VideoRecServiceServer, which was running on a container, to VideoService and UserService,
which were running locally on WSL2. I tried several solutions, but none of them worked.
There were some peculiarities with WSL2 that I could not figure out, so eventually I decided 
to just move on to deploying on Kubernetes, and that worked.
