## Tips on asking good questions / help us help you
- First, try to find the answer(s) by Googling. See the [Collaboration Policy](collaboration_policy.md) about rules re: code reuse and attribution.
- For technical questions, prefer posting publicly to Ed such that your classmates may answer your question(s) and benefit from the answer(s).
- Help your classmates by answering their questions! You are not in competition with one another, so help each other learn!
- Identify the [**minimum reproducible example**](https://myweb.uiowa.edu/pbreheny/reproducible.html) of your problem. E.g., for Go language related questions, attempt to construct a small example on [Go playground](https://go.dev/play/) (which has sharing functionality).
