What networking/socket API(s) do you think Dial corresponds to or is similar to?

Dial seems similar to the connect() in the socket API. connect() establishes a communication
link to a specific remote host (identified by its address) via a socket (identified by its file
descriptor). This is similar to Dial, which takes a server address and port number to establish
a gRPC channel.

In what cases do you think Dial() will fail? What status code do you think you should return for these cases?

Dial() may fail when the server is down, or when the port is occupied, or if the caller does not
have valid credentials. In the first two scenarios, the status code would be Unavailable (14). In
the third scenario, the status code would be Unauthenticated (7).
