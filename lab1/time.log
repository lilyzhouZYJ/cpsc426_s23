I discussed my solution with: Anna Zhang, Peter Yu

Discussion (major conceptual and coding difficulties):

One major conceptual difficulty is just to understand how the system works, in
particular, how the different components of the system come together and work
with each other. The diagrams provided in the lab were helpful, but it still
took me some time to internalize what we are trying to accomplish.

Another difficulty is just how many moving parts this lab involved. There is
batching, truncating results based on request limit, retry, fallback. Overall
there is just a lot of stuff to keep track of, and to test as well. This was
difficult because I found myself fixing one thing and then realizing another
thing broke in the process.
