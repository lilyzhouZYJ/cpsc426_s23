I discussed my solution with: Peter Yu, Anna Zhang

Discussion: (major conceptual and coding difficulties)
One major source of coding difficulty was my lack of familiarity with Go. I found myself
frequently consulting the documentation to figure out how to do the simplest things in Go,
like initializing a struct, appending a slice to another slice, etc. However, now I think
I have a much better grasp of Go. A conceptual difficulty was trying to understand the three
given approaches for keeping count in StripedStringSet. I spent quite some time just
thinking about how each approach would be implemented, and the pros and cons of each.
In particular, I was confused by how atomic counters worked, and how it would affect
both the locking scheme of the program and its performance, but it made more sense after
actually implementing the approach into my program.
