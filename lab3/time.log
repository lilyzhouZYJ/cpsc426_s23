----  -------  ----  --------------
02/24  3:30pm  0:40  Started lab, did some reading, parts of 3A-1.
02/25 12:00pm  2:50  3A-1
02/25  6:00pm  1:30  3A-1
02/26  2:25pm  0:30  Rereading raft paper
02/27  4:20pm  1:30  Cleaned up RPC receiving handlers
02/27  5:50pm  0:50  Why am I still working on the same stuff
03/04  3:50pm  1:00  Pass 3A-1 tests
03/04  4:50pm  0:35  3A-2 discussion
03/04  5:25pm  1:00  3B
03/05  7:20pm  2:00  3B
03/05 10:30pm  1:45  Finish 3B (user time is a bit long?)
03/06 12:40pm  0:50  Add 2 unit tests
03/06  1:30pm  0:25  More test
03/06  7:00pm  3:00  3C: not passing TestFigure8Unreliable3C and both Churn tests
03/07  8:50pm  4:30  Tried to refactor, not passing 3B tests (see lab3-refactor branch)
03/08  1:30pm  1:00  Continue refactoring
03/08  3:40pm  0:20  lab3-refactor might be a working version (at least for 3A and 3B)
03/08  4:00pm  1:00  Implement 3C-3 optimization, consistently passes 3A and 3B tests, but not the last 2 tests of 3C
03/08  7:30pm  1:20  Make some tweaks, pass TestReliableChurn3C with better probability

              26:35  TOTAL time spent

I discussed my solution with: Peter Yu, Anna Zhang

Discussion (major conceptual and coding difficulties):

TODO
- 5 unit tests total
- ExtraCredit1
- What to do if a majority of the cluster has failed?
- Check usage of prevLogTerm and prevLogIndex
- Check if assume that rf remains the same before and after sending RPC
- Follower/candidate crashes?
- Check time of testing
